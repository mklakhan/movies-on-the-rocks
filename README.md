# Movies on the Rocks
A web application that shakes up your movie night by recommending beverages based on the flicks you're watching, so you feel part of all the action!

## Approach
In this application we utilized the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to implement a search for movie titles & the associated genres. We also utilized the Cocktail DB API to return drink results with ingredients & instructions. Once a user confirms they are of legal drinking age, the user is able to "Get Started" by entering in a movie title or genre. Once the input is submitted, drink results are returned with ingredients and instructions. 

### Future Development
- Ability for the user to select the alcohol type, so that recommendations are personalized for the preferences of the user.
- Ability to save the drink recommendations in a favorites section so that a user can easily retrieve the drink recipes they enjoyed.
- Ability to dislike a drink recommendation so that a user can generate an alternative recommendation.
